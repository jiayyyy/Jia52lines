        <h1>Jiajia Wu Bio</h1>
        <p>Jiajia Wu was born and raised in Taiwan. In 2018, he moved to New York to study at Pace University, where he majored in Art and minored in Sociocultural Anthropology, earning his bachelor’s degree in 2022. Wu previously worked as a curatorial assistant at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, contributing to the planning and production of arts festivals and exhibitions. After returning to Taiwan, he worked as a program specialist and production executive at the Ju Percussion Group Foundation. He is currently a freelancer, actively engaged in artistic creation and interdisciplinary collaborations.</p>
        <p>His artistic practice includes painting, papercutting, material-based work, installation, and performance. Fascinated by the experimental exploration of texture and perception, Wu focuses on the relationship between the embioied experience and physicality. His work often begins with bodily perception and cultural flows, exploring the tensions between the individual and society. He seeks to use art as a form of inquiry, responding through artistic expression to the complexities of human emotions and relationships that are difficult to articulate in words.</p>
        <h1>52Lines Studio</h1>
        <p>52lines studio is the personal art portfolio of Jiajia Wu—a space for collecting ongoing thoughts, experiments, and reflections in visual form. The name “52lines” plays on the rhythm of time and process, referencing both structure and spontaneity. It is not a physical studio but a conceptual one: a space for crossing disciplines, sharing stories, and mapping the subtle intersections between art, body, and everyday life.</p>
