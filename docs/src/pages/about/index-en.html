        <h1>Jiajia Wu</h1>
        <p>Jiajia Wu was born and raised in Taiwan. In 2018, he moved to New York to study at Pace University, where he majored in Art and minored in Sociocultural Anthropology, earning his bachelorâ€™s degree in 2022. Wu previously worked as a curatorial assistant at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, contributing to the planning and production of arts festivals and exhibitions. After returning to Taiwan, he worked as a project coordinator and performance production manager at the Ju Percussion Group Foundation. He is currently a freelancer, actively engaged in artistic creation and interdisciplinary collaborations.

            His artistic practice includes painting, papercutting, material-based work, installation, and performance. Fascinated by the experimental exploration of texture and perception, Wu focuses on the relationship between the body, materiality, and emotion. His work often begins with bodily perception and cultural flows, exploring the tensions between the individual and society. He seeks to use art as a form of inquiry, responding through artistic expression to the complexities of human emotions and relationships that are difficult to articulate in words.</p>
