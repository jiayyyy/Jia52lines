                <h2>《Letters》2024</h2>
                <p>In today’s age of advanced digital communication, letters are rarely used for everyday 
                    interaction. Most physical mail now exists in the form of formal documents or official 
                    notices. As a tangible medium, a letter must be physically delivered to the recipient’s 
                    location to be read, making the transmission slower and more prone to loss compared to 
                    digital messages. However, when words and thoughts are transformed into a physical 
                    letter, the result is a communication medium that carries a deeper sense of intimacy 
                    and emotional connection.

                    The work Letter involves overlapping papercuts on postcards to form fragmented written 
                    messages. Each piece contains separate, broken text. The cut-outs and negative space 
                    created by the papercuts divide radicals and letters, and the recipient must physically 
                    align the two layers to fully read the message. In this piece, I experiment with 
                    deconstructing language from its function as a vessel of meaning, turning words into 
                    something like eraser shavings—fragments that aren’t simply erased but compressed, 
                    crumpled, and left as residue. The desire to express becomes a process of reflection 
                    before writing, with the imagined presence of the recipient guiding the message—someone 
                    with whom I share a bond from the past, now addressed in the present with wishes for 
                    the future.
                    
                    Recipients include long-lost friends, deceased family members, and overseas 
                    acquaintances. This project will continue as a long-term practice. I firmly believe 
                    that the difference between handwritten letters and digital text goes beyond speed 
                    and convenience. The few grams of weight in a letter can serve as a substitute for 
                    the physical body that cannot be present beside the person on the other end.</p>
